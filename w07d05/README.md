# W07D05 - Custom Hooks

### To Do
- [x] Custom Hooks
- [x] `useDocumentTitle`
- [x] `useMousePosition` (tests)
- [x] `useInput` (tests)
- [x] `useRequest`
- [x] `useKeyPress`

`useVisualMode` => history of previous modes that the Appointment has been in
['EMPTY', 'CREATE', 'SAVING', 'ERROR_SAVE']
transition => move forward in time
back => move backwards in time

`useApplicationData` => manage all state for the app


### Custom Hook
* helper function (keep our code DRY || hide something complex)
* that use hooks internally
* have to start with `use`


```js
const user = {
  username
};
```
